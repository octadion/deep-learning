# Deep Learning Projects Repository

## Introduction
This repository contains various deep learning projects, demonstrating the application of different algorithms and techniques on real-world datasets.

## Projects

### Project 1 : [Dog Cat Classification using EfficientNetV2](./Dog%Cat%Classification%using%EfficientNetV2/HW_DAY5_One_Octadion.ipynb)
This project uses the EfficientNetV2 model to classify images into two categories: dogs and cats. The model is trained on a dataset of dog and cat images and aims to accurately predict the animal present in a given image.

### Project 2: [Dog Cat Classification using EfficientNetV2 with PCA](./Dog%Cat%Classification%using%EfficientNetV2 with PCA/HW_DAY6_One_Octadion.ipynb)
This project extends the previous one by incorporating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data. This can potentially improve the modelâ€™s performance by focusing on the most important features of the images.

### Project 3: [Sentiment Analysis using DNN](./Sentiment%Analysis%using%DNN/PR_day20_One_Octadion.ipynb)
This project uses a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to perform sentiment analysis on text data. The goal is to determine whether the sentiment of a given text is positive, negative, or neutral.

### Project 4: [Butterfly Classification using Convolutional Neural Network](./Butterfly%Classification%using%Convolutional%Neural Network/PR_day21_One_Octadion.ipynb)
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of butterflies. The model is trained on a dataset of butterfly images and aims to accurately classify the species of a butterfly from a given image.
